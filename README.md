Simplr - is a text editor made in C by following Salvatore Sanfilippo's tutorial. <br />
I recommend every C beginner to try and make something like this using Salvatore's tutorial. 

Visit his GitHub page and website where he published the tutorial. <br />
DISCLAIMER: Simplr is not fully built, it lacks some function commands such as CTRL+C/V.
